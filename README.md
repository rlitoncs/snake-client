# Snake (Client Side)
A client-side implementation of the terminal-base Snake written in JavaScript (Node.js).


## Instructions
In order to play the game, both server side and client side need to be installed.

The link to installing the server side for Snake can be [found here](https://github.com/rlitoncs/snek-multiplayer).

Once the server side is installed, you are ready to install the client side!

## Installation
### Clone from Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:rlitoncs/snake-client.git
cd snake-client

# Two Terminals should be opened simultaneously, one for the server and one for the client. Ensure the Server is up and running before you connect to it from the client side
node play.js
```
